         <div class="last-updated">Last updated on February 07, 2020</div>
         <p>Thank you for choosing Apptegy. Protecting your privacy and securing the information we collect is very
            important to us, and we continuously work to do that well and to improve our privacy practices. </p>
         <p>We also want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect that information,
            how we use it, and what your rights are with respect to what we do. This policy explains those things.
         </p>
         <p>Please note that we offer multiple websites, software platforms, mobile applications, blogs, and other
            digital and print resources, including, but not limited to, our product Thrillshare®. We also provide
            services and support for those products. These policies apply to all of our products and services. We
            may also develop or offer new or additional products and services. These policies apply to all new and
            additional products and services.</p>
         <p>We may change these policies at any time without prior notice. For example, we recently added a
            California Privacy Notice for California consumers who visit or use our products and services. That is
            available in Section 5. We also added policies for individuals in the European Union who visit or use
            the Services. That is available in Section 6.</p>
         <p>If you have questions or concerns about our policies, please contact us at any of the following: </p>

         <h5>1. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</h5>
         <p>This section summarizes the key points of our privacy policies. Please review the full policy to find
            additional information and to better understand our policies and your rights related to the same.</p>
         <p>Summary of key points:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>What we collect about you, how we collect it, and how we use it depends on your relationship with
               us;</li>
            <li>We collect and use personal information so we can provide and improve our products and services;
            </li>
            <li>We do not attempt to monetize your personal information with third parties; and</li>
            <li>You have rights and choices that govern how we will handle personal information about you.</li>
         </ul>
         <h5>2. WHAT We Collect and How We Collect It</h5>
         <p>What information we collect about you and how we collect it depends on our relationship with you.
            Specifically:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>If your personal information is provided to us by your educational institution or organization (and
               not you directly), then an explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect
               it can be found below in the section 2.A titled “Personal Information from Institutions”; or</li>
            <li>If you visit or use our products and services under the account of your educational institution or
               organization, then an explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect it can
               be found below in the section 2.A titled “Personal Information from Institutions”; or</li>
            <li>If you visit or use our products and services as an individual user or through an individual account
               with us (i.e., not under an account of an educational institution or organization), then an
               explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect it can be found below in the
               section 2.B titled “Personal Information from Individual Users.”</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Please note that our customers are substantially educational institutions and organizations. This means
            that nearly all of the personal information that we collect and/or use is provided either (1) by
            educational institutions and organizations on behalf of the individuals associated with those accounts
            (i.e., not directly from the individuals), or (2) by individuals using our products and services under
            an educational institution and organization account (i.e., not under an individual account). In other
            words, we collect very little personal information directly from individual users under individual
            accounts.</p>
         <h5>2.A Personal Information from Institutions</h5>
         <p>As stated above, nearly all of the personal information that we collect and store is provided to us
            either by an educational institution or organization on behalf of the individuals associated with that
            institution’s or organization’s account, or by individuals visiting and using our products and services
            under an educational institution or organization account. </p>
         <p>A few examples of how and when this may happen include:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>an educational institution or organization accesses, downloads, logs in, uses, views content on,
               and/or otherwise interacts with one of our websites, software platforms, or mobile applications;
            </li>
            <li>an educational institution or organization submits personal information about individuals on one of
               our websites, software platforms, or mobile applications by uploading and publishing content, or by
               sending communications;</li>
            <li>an educational institution or organization interacts with us with respect to account maintenance or
               service (for example: billing or technical support, and product updates); or</li>
            <li>an individual does any of the foregoing actions under that person’s educational institution’s or
               organization’s account.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>In these instances, your educational institution or organization determines what personal information is
            provided to us, and what can be collected by us, under the institution’s or organization’s account. In
            other words, your educational institution or organization is the data controller for your personal
            information that is provided and collected in connection with its account with us. </p>
         <p>Because of that, your educational institution or organization is the party that is primarily responsible
            for the personal information about you that we collect in connection with your educational institution’s
            or organization’s account. And your educational institution or organization is the party that is
            primarily responsible for protecting the privacy of that personal information about you. </p>
         <p>In these circumstances, we are only a data processor. This means that we only carry out and process, via
            our products and services, the activities of and instructions from your educational institution or
            organization (and/or the individuals using our products and services under your educational
            institution’s or organization’s account). </p>
         <p><strong>Simply put: when we process personal information about you that is provided by your educational
               institution or organization (or by you or another individual under your educational institution’s or
               organization’s account), we are not responsible for the disclosures made by your educational
               institution or organization (or those individuals under the institution or organization account). It
               is your educational institution or organization that has the responsibility to protect your
               privacy.</strong></p>
         <p>Please note that the privacy and security policies of your educational institution or organization may
            differ from our policies. In those cases, our policies will not overrule or change the separate policies
            of your educational institution or organization, and our policies will not impact or change your
            educational institution’s or organization’s separate agreements with and obligations to you.
            <strong>Instead, the privacy and security policies of your educational institution or organization
               govern your personal information and your rights, and not our policies.</strong> As such, you are
            required to work with your educational institution or organization directly with respect to your
            personal information.</p>
         <p>Even though we are not primarily responsible for your personal information in these circumstances, we
            still want you to understand what personal information we might collect about you under these
            circumstances and how we collect that information.</p>
         <p>Educational institutions and organizations (and/or individuals using our products and services under
            educational institution and organization accounts) use our products and services to store, process,
            publish, and distribute communications, messages, videos, and other information about or relevant to the
            educational institution or organization. Depending on what products or services are used, and how they
            are used, some of that information may be viewable by the public, and some of that information may be
            restricted to limited recipients and/or viewers. Some of that information may include personal
            information about you. As explained above, the educational institutions and organizations (and/or the
            individuals using our products and services under educational institution and organization accounts)
            make those choices and are responsible for them.</p>
         <p>Specifically, the following personal information may be collected under or in connection with educational
            institution and organization accounts:</p>

               and/or disclose personal information with third parties to provide, promote, and improve our

            <li>To measure and improve client engagement: We may use and/or disclose personal information to help us
               measure and improve our engagement with our users (for example: we use Google Analytics to help us
               understand how our users use our products and services – you can read more about how Google uses our
               information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy and you can also opt-out of Google

         </ul>
         <p>When we use and/or disclose personal information with third party vendors, those vendors must abide by
            our privacy and security instructions and requirements. Third party vendors are not allowed to access or
            use information from us, except only as needed to do their particular work with us.</p>
         <p>When we use and/or disclose personal information for legal purposes or in connection with our corporate
            business purposes, we will try to limit the information we provide as much as possible, and we will
            condition our sharing of that information on strict confidentiality restrictions as often as possible.
         </p>
         <p>Please note that we will not use or disclose information (whether personal or otherwise) about individual
            students that is collected through educational institution and organization accounts for the purpose of
            targeted advertising.</p>
         <p>We may also use and/or disclose anonymized or generalized aggregated information with third parties for
            various reasons, including to promote and improve our products and services. In these circumstances, we
            will take appropriate measures to de-identify (and prevent any party from re-identifying) any
            information used or disclosed in this way.</p>
         <h5>4. ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; TRACKING; OPT-OUT</h5>
         <p>As explained above, we may use your information for limited advertising and marketing purposes, including
            to contact you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you, and to promote

            communications, or change your preferences. You may also contact us by email at privacy@apptegy.com to
            manage your marketing communication preferences at any time.</p>
         <p>We may use cookies, beacons, and other similar tracking technologies. For example, we use cookies to help
            us measure and improve our engagement with our users by analyzing the usage trends and patterns for our
            websites, platforms, and mobile applications, and to promote products and services that we believe may
            be of interest to you. In some cases, you may manage the use of cookies for our products and services by

         <h5>5. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE</h5>
         <p>This California Privacy Notice applies only to individual users of our products and services who are
            residents of the State of California, and only where we act as a “business” with or for that individual.
            For example, this section applies for California residents who use our products and services as an
            individual user or through an individual account with us (i.e., not under an account of an educational
            institution or organization). For these users, this section is a supplement to the other parts of our
            policies.</p>
         <p>However, this section does not apply when we provide our products and services to individual users under
            an account of an educational institution or organization. In these instances, as explained in more
            detail in section 2 above, the privacy and security policies of your educational institution or
            organization govern your personal information and your rights, and not our policies.</p>
         <p>This California Privacy Notice describes how we as a business collect, use, disclose, and otherwise
            process personal information of individual residents of the State of California within the scope of the
            California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).</p>

         <h5>7. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY AND OTHER REGULATORY NOTICES</h5>
         <p>As explained above, our customers are substantially educational institutions and organizations. By using
            our products and services, these educational institutions and organizations (or individuals using our
            products and services under an institution or organization account) may provide us with educational
            records and other personally identifiable information about students. Protecting and securing student
            information is very important to us, and we continuously work to do that well and to improve our

         <p>We do not permit individual users or individual accounts for individuals under the age of 13. In
            addition, we do not knowingly collect any information about or from children under the age of 13, except
            when an educational institution or organization (or an individual under an institution or organization
            account) provides information about or from a student under the age of 13 via our goods and services. We
            collect, use, process, and store the information solely to provide our goods and services to or on
            behalf of the educational institution or organization that is our client. If you have any questions or

            guarantee the total security of your information in all circumstances. </p>
