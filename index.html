            <p><em>Last updated on November 15, 2021</em></p>
            <p>Thank you for choosing Thrillshare and EduRooms, products and services provided by Apptegy, Inc. (collectively, including our subsidiaries and other affiliates, “<strong>Apptegy</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”). Protecting your privacy and securing the information we collect is very important to us, and we continuously work to do that well and to improve our privacy practices. </p>
            <p>We want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect that information, how we use it, and what your rights are with respect to what we do. This policy explains those things.</p>
            <p>We take great care in protecting the information of children and comply with all state and federal data privacy regulations.  More information is available in Section 7.</p>
            <p>Please note that we offer multiple websites, software platforms, mobile applications, blogs, and other digital and print resources, including, but not limited to, our website www.apptegy.com (the “<strong>Apptegy Site</strong>”) and our products Thrillshare, accessible at www.thrillshare.com (“<strong>Thrillshare</strong>”), and EduRooms, accessible at www.edurooms.com (“<strong>Rooms</strong>”). We also provide services and support for our products. PLEASE NOTE that certain users may access and use Thrillshare and/or Rooms through links provided on the separate website and/or mobile application of an educational institution or organization (a “<strong>School</strong>”). </p>
            <p>These policies apply to all of our products and services, including new or additional products and services that we may develop or offer in the future (collectively, including the Apptegy Site, Thrillshare, Rooms, and all other products and all services, the “<strong>Services</strong>”), and apply whether you access the Services directly via our products or via a School website or application.</p>
            <p>We may change these policies at any time without prior notice. For example, we recently added a California Privacy Notice for California consumers who visit or use our Services. That is available in Section 5. </p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns about our policies, please contact us at any of the following: </p>

            <p><strong>1.	SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</strong></p>
            <p>This section summarizes the key points of our privacy policies. Please review the full policy to find additional information and to better understand our policies and your rights related to the same.</p>
            <p>Summary of key points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> What we collect about you, how we collect it, and how we use it depends on your relationship with us;</li>
                <li> We collect and use personal information so we can provide and improve our Services;&nbsp;</li>
                <li> We do not monetize or attempt to monetize your personal information with third parties; and</li>
                <li> You have rights and choices that govern how we will handle personal information about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2.	WHAT We Collect and How We Collect It</strong></p>
            <p>What information we collect about you and how we collect it depends on our relationship with you. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> School Provides Us With Your Personal Information: If your personal information is provided to us by a School (and not you directly), then an explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect it can be found below in the section 2.A titled “Personal Information from Schools”; or </li>
                <li> You Provide Us With Your Personal Information Through a School-Created User Account: If you visit or use our Services as an authorized user under the account of a School or as a user in connection with Services made available by a School (for example: a teacher, administrator, staff, parent, guardian, student) (collectively, a “<strong>School-Created User Account</strong>”), then an explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect it can be found below in the section 2.A titled “Personal Information from Schools.”</li>
                <li> You Access Our Products But Do Not Utilize Our Services Via A School-Created User Account: If you only access the Apptegy Site, Thrillshare, or Rooms, but do not access our Services via a School-Created User Account, then an explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect it can be found below in the section 2.B titled “Visitors’ Personal information.” </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note that our customers are Schools. We do not currently provide or offer individual user accounts for the Services. The personal information we collect and/or use is provided either (1) by Schools (i.e., not directly from individual users), or (2) through School-Created User Account using our Services under a School account, whether the access or use happens directly via our Services or is made available via the School’s website or applications. </p>
            <p><strong>2.A	Personal Information from Schools</strong></p>
            <p>As stated above, all of the personal information that we collect and store is provided to us either by a School on behalf of the individuals associated with that School’s account, or by a School-Created User Account visiting and using our Services under or in connection with a School account. </p>
            <p>A few examples of how and when this may happen include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> a School submits personal information to a School account and sets up School-Created User Accounts for teachers, administrators, staff, parents, guardians, or students, and includes personal information in setting up those School-Created User Accounts;&nbsp;</li>
                <li> a School-Created User Account, on behalf of the School in her or his capacity as a School employee, accesses, uploads, uses, and/or otherwise interacts with Thrillshare and/or Rooms and includes personal information in her or his use;</li>
                <li> a School-Created User Account, on behalf of the School in her or his capacity as a School employee, submits personal information about one or more individuals on or via Thrillshare or Rooms by uploading and publishing content that includes personal information, or by sending communications that include personal information;</li>
                <li> a School-Created User Account, on behalf of the School in her or his capacity as a School employee, interacts with us with respect to maintaining the School’s account or for customer service (for example: technical support) and includes personal information in her or his communications;&nbsp;</li>
                <li> a School-Created User Account assigned to a student utilizes the comment or chat function, or assignment submission function of Rooms and includes personal information in her or his use; or</li>
                <li> a School User does any of the foregoing actions in her or his individual capacity under or in connection with her or his School’s account. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In any and all of these instances, the School determines what personal information is and can be provided to us by School-Created User Accounts, and what can be collected by us, under the School’s account. In other words, the School is the data controller for the personal information that is provided and collected in connection with the School’s account with us. </p>
            <p>Because of that, your School is the party that is primarily responsible for the personal information that we collect in connection with your School’s account. And your School is the party that is primarily responsible for protecting the privacy of your personal information, and whether and how it is made available on our Services. </p>
            <p>In any and all of these circumstances, Apptegy is only a data processor. This means that we only carry out and process, via our Services, the activities of and instructions from your School (and/or the School-Created User Accounts using Services under the School’s account). </p>
            <p><strong>Simply put: when we process activities and instructions from a School that include personal information about you (or by you or another School-Created User Account under or in connection with a School account), we are not responsible for the disclosures made by the School (or School-Created User Account under or in connection with the School account). It is your School that has the responsibility to protect your privacy. </strong> </p>
            <p>Please note that the privacy and security policies of your School may differ from our policies. In those cases, our policies will not overrule or change the separate policies of your School, and our policies will not impact or change your School’s separate agreements with and obligations to you. <strong>Instead, the privacy and security policies of your School govern your personal information and your rights, and not our policies.</strong> As such, you are required to work with your School directly with respect to your personal information.</p>
            <p>Even though we are not primarily responsible for your personal information in these circumstances, we still want you to understand what personal information we might collect about you under these circumstances and how we collect and protect that information.</p>
            <p>Schools (and/or School-Created User Accounts using our Services under or in connection with School accounts) use our Services to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Via Thrillshare – manage, store, process, publish, and distribute communications, messages, announcements, videos, and other information about or relevant to the School generally; and</li>
                <li> Via Rooms – manage, store, exchange, process, publish, evaluate, accept, and distribute assignments, communications, messages, announcements, chats, videos, and other information about or relevant to a particular classroom(s) at the School.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For Thrillshare, some of the personal information submitted may be viewable by the public. For Rooms, the information submitted is restricted to other School-Created User Accounts with specific permission to access or view a particular classroom(s) at the School. As explained above, Schools (and/or the School-Created User Accounts using our Services under or in connection with School accounts) make those choices and are responsible for them.</p>
            <p>Specifically, the following personal information may be collected under or in connection with our Services:</p>
            <table class="table">

In these circumstances, we will take appropriate measures to de-identify (and prevent any party from re-identifying) any information used or disclosed in this way.</p>

            <strong> 4.	ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; TRACKING; OPT-OUT</strong></p>
            <p>As explained above, we may use your information for limited advertising and marketing purposes, including to contact Schools and School-Created User Accounts assigned to teachers, administrators, or staff s in their capacity as School employees and contractors about Services that we believe may be of interest to you, and to promote events and other resources that you may be interested in. We will not contact School-Created User Accounts assigned to parents, guardians, and students with respect to the foregoing. </p>
            <p>Our marketing communications will include instructions for how to opt-out of all or a portion of these communications, or change your preferences.

            <p>We may use cookies, beacons, and other similar tracking technologies. However, we only use them for the purpose of providing and improving our Services to and for our users. We do not use them for marketing or advertising purposes. For example, we use cookies to help us measure and improve our engagement with our users by analyzing the usage trends and patterns for our websites, platforms, and mobile applications, and to promote Services that we believe may be of interest to you. In some cases, you may manage the use of cookies for our Services by adjusting your individual browser settings.

            <p><strong>5.	CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE</strong></p>
            <p>This California Privacy Notice applies only to individual users of our Services who are residents of the State of California, and only where we act as a “business” with or for that individual. For example, this section applies for California residents who use our Services as an individual user or through an individual account with us (i.e., not under an account of a School). For these users, this section is a supplement to the other parts of our policies.</p>
            <p>However, this section does not apply when we provide our Services to individual users through a School-Created User Account under an account of a School. In these instances, as explained in more detail in section 2 above, the privacy and security policies of your School govern your personal information and your rights, and not our policies.</p>
            <p>This California Privacy Notice describes how we as a business collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information of individual residents of the State of California within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”).</p>
            <p>The categories of personal information that we collect and the sources from which we collect that information are:</p>

            <p>If you are a qualifying California resident under CCPA, we provide the following rights with respect to your personal information when we act as a “business” with or for you (subject to certain limitations in the CCPA):</p>

            <p>If you are an individual resident of the European Union, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information, including under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This includes, among other rights, the right to be informed and request access to the personal information about you that we have collected via our Services.

            <p><strong>7.	CHILDREN’S PRIVACY AND OTHER REGULATORY NOTICES</strong></p>
            <p>As explained above, our customers are Schools. By using our Services, Schools (and School-Created User Accounts using our Services under or in connection with a School account) may provide us with educational records and other personally identifiable information about students. Please see Section 2.A (Personal Information from Schools) for more information about student information collected by Schools and School Users using Services under or in connection with a School account, including children under the age of 13.</p>
            <p>Protecting and securing student information is very important to us, and we continuously work to do that well and to improve our practices. We understand that this information is regulated by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and other applicable laws that relate to the collection and use of personal information of students. We continuously work to comply with all such laws. If you have any questions or concerns about the personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.</p>
            <p>We do not permit individual accounts for any individual, including children under the age of 13. However, children under the age of 13 may receive a School-Created User Account as a student user of Rooms. We do not knowingly collect any information about or from children under the age of 13, except when a School (or a School-Created User Account under or in connection with a School account) consents to the collection of information about or from a student under the age of 13 via our Services. We collect, use, process, and store the information solely to provide the Services to or on behalf of the School that is our customer. Apptegy does not disclose student information to third parties except as reasonably necessary to support the internal operations of the Services, as further set out in Section 3. If you have any questions or concerns about the personal information of a student under the age of 13, or you are a parent or guardian and want to review the personal information of your student that is collected or stored by Apptegy, please contact your School directly.</p>
            <p>While most parts of the Services do not require any personal information to be provided, and we will not require any more personal information than is reasonably necessary to support the internal operations of the Services, we encourage parents to monitor their child’s use of the Services, particularly including Rooms, and to assist us by instructing them never to provide personal information on the Services, particularly including Rooms, without your permission.</p>
            <p><strong>8.	SECURITY OF INFORMATION; DATA RETENTION AND TRANSFERS</strong></p>
            <p>The security of personal information is very important to us, and we continuously work to protect that information well and to improve our practices. We have taken steps that we believe are reasonable to safeguard against the unauthorized access and use of personal information. However, we cannot and do not guarantee the total security of your information in all circumstances. </p>
            <p>Please note that we are based in the United States, and your information will be transferred, processed, and stored in the United States and may be transferred, processed, and stored outside of the United States, including Mexico (for example: for support and maintenance of our Services). Protecting your privacy and securing the information we store and transfer is very important to us, and we continuously work to do that well and to improve our data storage and transfer practices. By using our goods and services, or providing us with any information, you are consenting to the transfer, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information, including personal information, in the United States and in the other jurisdictions where we do business.</p>
            <p>We may retain your information, including personal information, for as long as permitted under applicable law.</p>

            <p><strong>10.	THIRD PARTY FUNCTIONALITY AND TOOLS</strong></p>
            <p>We use or may use third party providers for various aspects of our Services. For example, Schools (or School-Created User Accounts using Services under or in connection with a School account) may post and publish communications, messages, announcements, videos, or other information from Thrillshare or Rooms to Facebook, Twitter, and other media channels. By using any of these tools or resources on our Services, you will also be subject to the third party policies for those third party services. <strong>Please note that these third party policies may be materially different than our policies, especially with regard to information privacy and security.</strong></p>
            <p>There may be links or references on our Services to other products and services that are offered by third parties. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy and security practices and policies of any third party. If you choose to access or use any such third party product or service, you do so at your own risk.</p>
            <p><strong>11.	MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>
            <p>We may change these policies from time to time in our discretion. Any changes will be effective immediately upon us posting the updated policy. New policies will be posted at this page, and we encourage you to review it regularly. If we make updates or changes, we will give notice of that by updating the posted date for this policy and, in some cases and in our sole discretion, we may provide you with additional notice (for example: by notice on the Apptegy Site, Thrillshare, Rooms, and any of our other websites, platforms, and/or mobile applications, or by sending you a notification).</p>
